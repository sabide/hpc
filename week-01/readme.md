## Week-1 / Lecture-1 – Objectives

In this first session, students will learn to:

* **connect to the AZZURRA HPC cluster** ( [https://calculs.univ-cotedazur.fr](https://calculs.univ-cotedazur.fr)  )
* **understand and set up the compilation tool-chain** (modules, compilers, MPI, libraries)
* **use Slurm job scheduler within a CMake workflow**
  (submit jobs, compile with CMake on compute nodes, batch vs interactive builds)

## Week-1 / Lecture-2 – Objectives
In this lecture, students will:

* work on a **1D/2D wave equation example**
* analyze the **memory layout of arrays and fields**
* understand **data locality and cache behavior**
* explore how memory layout impacts:
  * numerical loops
